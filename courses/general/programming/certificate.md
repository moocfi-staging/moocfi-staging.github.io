Certificates are currently downloadable for Object oriented programming with Java, part I and part II courses. Certificates become downloadable after you have been rewarded at least 85% of the points from the last week of the course.

# How to download certificate

Go to <https://tmc.mooc.fi/mooc> and *Sign in*. After signing in open *My Stats* from the upper navigation bar and click the *Certificates* link which is located just under your account details.

When you get to the certificates page you should see a *form* with course and name inputs. Select the course of which you want the certificate generated and fill in your name. Your name will be remembered for the next times. 

**Note!** Generating certificates for numerous different names may lead to you losing ability to download any certificates now and in the future. 

If you don't see the form you most probably haven't completed enough of any of the courses to be able to download a certificate at this time. Don't worry, you can still complete the missing assignments and afterwards download the certificate.
