**Welcome to [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/)'s massive open online course (MOOC) on C prorgamming!**

During this course you will learn all the basics of computer programming and algorithms using the C programming language. The course includes comprehensive course materials and plenty of programming exercises, each tested using our automatic testing service [Test My Code](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server).

**Anyone can join - no previous programming knowledge is required.**

Unlike many programming courses found online, ours is completely unabridged: the course's scope and material are **identical to our own C programming** programming courses.

This course is natural continuation for our Java MOOC courses but can also be taken without having taken the Java MOOCs.

This course is organized in collaboration with Aalto University and University of Helsinki, this course covers basics of the C programming language.

The course must be completed by 31.8.2016 but there are no other deadlines so you may progress at your own pace. To proceed from one module to the next one you must get at least 80% of exercise points of the module.
