**Welcome to [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/)'s massive open online course (MOOC) on C programming!**

This course will teach you the basics of the C programming language. There are no special prerequisites, but some previous programming experience will be helpful. Students that have taken the Java MOOC classes offered by mooc.fi are more than well equipped to tackle this course, but the contents of the Java course are **not** prerequisites.

The course includes comprehensive online materials and plenty of programming exercises, each tested using our automatic testing service [Test My Code](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server). If you have previously taken the Java MOOC, then you should be familiar with most of the tools used.

The course is presented to you jointly by the Aalto University and the <a href="http://cs.helsinki.fi/en/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'outbound-c2016-hy-en')" target="_blank">University of Helsinki</a>, and the material is identical to the C programming courses offered by said universities.

# Deadlines

The course must be completed by 31.8.2016 but there are no other deadlines so you may progress at your own pace. To proceed from one module to the next one you must get at least 80% of exercise points of the module.

It usually takes 10 - 15 hours for completing each exercise set. However, this greatly depends on previous experience.
